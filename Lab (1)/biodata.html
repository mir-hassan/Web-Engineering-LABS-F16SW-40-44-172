	<p><b>About: </b>Crash Bandicoot is the title character and main protagonist of the Crash Bandicoot series.<br> 
	Introduced in the 1996 video game Crash Bandicoot, Crash is a mutant eastern barred bandicoot who was<br> 
	genetically enhanced by the series' main antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex and soon escaped from Cortex's castle<Br>
	 after a failed experiment in the "Cortex Vortex". Throughout the series, Crash acts as the opposition against<br>
	  Cortex and his schemes for world domination. While Crash has a number of offensive maneuvers at his disposal,<br> 
	his most distinctive technique is one in which he spins like a tornado at high speeds and knocks away almost<br>
	anything that he strikes.</p>
